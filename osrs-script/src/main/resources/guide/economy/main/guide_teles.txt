Teleporting

The home teleport spell in your magic spellbook will teleport you back home.

By using the blue wizard located west of the Edgeville bank you are able to directly teleport to most of the important locations within the game. One exception to this would be if you were attempting to teleport to the King Black Dragon lair. Teleporting tabs are also available for purchase from the head chef (General Store).

Fairy rings and the Spirit Trees are also useful teleport options.
